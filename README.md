📊 Internet Usage Data Analysis & Visualization
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing internet usage patterns using Python. It demonstrates how to handle real-world data, clean it, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build informative visualizations to draw meaningful insights.

📁 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Understand patterns in internet usage behavior across different variables.

Clean and preprocess the dataset for effective analysis.

Generate statistical summaries and visualizations using Python libraries.

Communicate findings in a clear and concise manner.

This project is particularly useful for data analysts, beginners learning EDA, or anyone interested in user behavior analytics.

🧠 Technologies & Tools Used
Python

pandas for data manipulation

matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for development environment

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is internet_usage.csv, which contains information related to internet usage behavior. (You can replace this with a brief description of the columns if you want.)

🚀 How It Works
Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values (mean/mode imputation).

Convert data types and format columns.

Remove duplicates or irrelevant fields.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generate statistical summaries (mean, median, mode, etc.).

Understand distributions of numerical and categorical variables.

Visualization

Use bar plots, histograms, line charts, and heatmaps to visualize trends and patterns.

Explore correlations between variables.

Insight Generation

Identify usage trends, peak times, or anomalies.

Support findings with visual evidence.
